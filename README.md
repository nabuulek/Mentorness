# Mentorness Internship projects

## Introduction
This repository includes Mentorness internship projects that I attenpted to get hands-on experience with real world projects that require use of data analysis for better decision making. This single file explains how the projects were addressed and executed, the tools used and as well the justifications of whatever was done.

## Projects
### Reeel on SQL.
This assignmnet require giving an explanation on what SQL was in just 1 minute with a video submission.

### Game analysis with SQL
In this project, the task was to use SQL as a tool to answer some questions on games with the help of two available datasets; players and levels datasets. These questions gave me the ability to levarage things like JOINS, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, and CLAUSES among others.

### Aiplane Crash Analysis with PowerBI
This internship project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of airplane crashes and fatalities spanning from 1980 to 2023. The dataset contains crucial information such as crash dates, locations, operators, flight details, aircraft types, and fatality statistics. The goal is to leverage Power BI for interactive visualizations and in-depth insights to understand patterns, contributing factors, and trends in aviation incidents. The analysis aims to provide stakeholders with valuable information for enhancing aviation safety and mitigating risks.
For purposes of this project, PowerBI was used as a data transformation and visualization tool to gain insights from geospatial, temporal, operation, aircraft, route, and fatalities analysis. The delivarables where interactive Power BI dashboards presenting visualizations of temporal, geospatial, and operational
analyses, reports on operator performance, aircraft involvement, and fatality trends, and insights into potential risk factors and recommendations for improving aviation safety.
